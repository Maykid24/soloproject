OTC (Over The Course) Shooting application is an application used for scoring high power competition shooting. It asks the user to enter in information about the date, location, state, competitors name, and score from various ranges. The program will then calculate the final result of each competitor and post in a table of the final result.

The reason why I created this application is due to the fact that I myself am a competitive shooter and the big poster boards were hard to write on and edit as well. This application replaces the frustration between pen and paper to a more efficient way of completing the same task. This way the scorer of the competition will be able to email the scores in instead of sending it in the mail.

This code is not complete and will still be worked on throughout the year.
